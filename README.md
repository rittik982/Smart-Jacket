hardware for practical implementation in real-world conditions.
3.2. All about equipments used:
Sensors:
Temperature sensor
Temperature sensor used in this smart jacket is LM35. LM35 has 3 pins i.e. Ground (GND)
pin,VCC(+5V),and an analog output. It is rated with a temperature range from -25oC to
+125oC.The 1
oC change in temperature generates near-about 10 mV. The specified limits in the
smart helmet is 36oC to 39oC.Whenever the temperature operates in between these limits,
buzzer and vibrating motor acts and gives a rescue signal.
Gas Sensor
The gas sensor used here is MQ5 which primarily detects the presence of methane gas with a
concentration range of 300 ppm to 10000 ppm. This range is considerably good to detect any
presence of gas leaks in the mines or any petroleum industry. This sensor is a 4 pin sensor with
one pin open means with no connection while other three pins are VCC (+5V), a ground
(GND), and an analog output which can be connected to any of the analog pins of the analog.
A resistance of 1K is connected between the ground pin and analog output pin. The
temperature operating range of this sensor is in between -10oC to 50oC and consumption is
less than 150 mA at 5V.
Humidity Sensor
Humidity Sensor is used to give workers favorable working conditions. It is a 4 pin sensor. It
has a VCC (+5V), a ground (GND) and a data pin. One of the pins has no connection, it acts as
open. The two probes are inserted in the soil which gives the presence of water in the soil. So it
can be also used to detect the presence of the water inside the mine. The muddy surface is not
safe workable conditions for the workers. Humidity is the amount of water present in the air. It
is the parameter in the wellness of mankind. We may feel comfortable when the air is dry,
where temperature is 0
oC and also the surroundings may not feel comfortable to us when
humidity is high when temperature is 100oC.
Alarming System:
Buzzer
It is a two terminal audio signalling device.one of the terminal is connected to +5V whereas
other is connected to the Ground. It consumes 70 mA while giving audio-signalling. Buzzer
can attract the focus of the workers on the danger. Buzzer acts in coordination with the
vibration motor.
LED
LED is used for light signalling. Combination of multiple LED's in a single strip can create a
higher amount of light waves, which are sufficient for distracting people from their work and
giving them signals of danger. LED's work in coordination with the vibration motor and
buzzer.
LCD
LCD is used for continuous monitoring and controlling purposes. Yes, miners canâ€™t see these
less interesting parameters on the screen of LCD but those values can be used for controlling
and rescuing people from mines, only if it is interfaced with the outer controlling station.
